# Drone-Surveillance-and-safe-zone
This project implements a real-time drone detection and monitoring system using YOLOv5 object detection and OpenCV for video processing. The system captures live video from a webcam (or a video file) and identifies drones within the frame using a custom-trained YOLOv5 model. A user-definable restricted area is drawn on the video feed, which can be interactively adjusted by dragging the rectangle’s corners with the mouse. When a drone enters or intersects this restricted area, the system triggers a visual warning on the video frame, displaying both the detection confidence and the drone’s position. This solution combines deep learning-based object detection with an intuitive graphical interface, providing a practical tool for monitoring no-fly zones and ensuring aerial safety.
This project aims to develop a drone detection system using the YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once) deep learning model integrated with a Tkinter-based graphical user interface (GUI). The system allows users to upload an image and automatically detects drones or other objects of interest within it. The detection results are displayed on the GUI along with bounding boxes and class labels.
This system can be extended for real-time surveillance applications, drone zone monitoring, and public safety automation.

•	What is drone surveillance?
Drone surveillance is the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to capture still images and video from a distance or at a high altitude to gather information about specific targets, which may be individuals, groups, or the environment.
Drones' small size, ability to fly, and withstand harsh environments mean they can often survey objects that may be out of reach and can get a first-person view that photographers don't usually get. Nowadays, security drones equipped with live video cameras, infrared cameras, thermal sensors, and LiDAR are used in large numbers by law enforcement.
